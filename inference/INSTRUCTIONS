The predictions must be saved to /output/predictions.tsv and have the following TSV format:

subjectId      laterality      confidence
1       L      0.01 
1       R      0.05 
2       L      0.00
2       R      0.01 

First, the predictions file must include the above header as the scoring script refers to the column by their name. The first column contains the ID of the subject and the second column the laterality of the breast (left or right). The third column contains the confidence level predicted by the inference method that a breast will develop cancer within 12 months. The confidence level must take values in [0,1], where 0 means that the breast will not develop cancer and 1 means that the breast will develop a cancer for sure.
 
Below are all the requirements that a prediction file must follow for it to be scored.
* Predictions MUST be a TSV file and MUST be named predictions.tsv
* Prediction file MUST have the headers (case sensitive): subjectId, laterality, confidence
* A sample is considered as subjectId + laterality (Ex. 0001R, 0001L)
* Laterality MUST be either R, or L. Please do not use lowercase letters or right/left.
* No duplicated samples allowed
* All samples in the prediction file MUST exist in the goldstandard
* Confidence values cannot be negative
* Must at least have one confidence value (Can't submit all NA or blank file)
* Empty confidence/missing samples will be imputed with the median of confidence values
